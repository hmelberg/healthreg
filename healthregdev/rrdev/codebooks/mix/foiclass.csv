The base has two buttons that allow the user to select the stimulation level (device is locked from use after a predetermined amount of stimulation has been triggered). The device is powered by a rechargeable battery.","The device activates tear production through stimulation of the nasolacrimal reflex. Stimulation activates the primary sensory afferent fibers in the ophthalmic and maxillary branches of the trigeminal nerve (CNV1 and CNV2). The device design limits the insertion length of the intranasal tips to ensure the probes do not physically reach the olfactory nerve fibers of nasal mucosa. The pulses delivered induce action potentials in the surrounding nerve tissue by creating transient voltage depolarization in activated neurons.
